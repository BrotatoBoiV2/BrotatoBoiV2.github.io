    <h2>About</h2>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 7vh;">
        Hi, I'm BrotatoBoi. I am a Computer Scientist who enjoys building software that blends creativity, experimentation, 
        and technical depth â€” from Python simulations and AI-powered programs, to games and custom operating systems. 
        I love exploring new ideas, pushing technology in unusual ways, and making projects that are both fun and functional. 
        Outside of code, I enjoy learning languages, experimenting with AI, and finding clever ways to simplify complex systems.
