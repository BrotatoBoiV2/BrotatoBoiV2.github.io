    <h2>Game of Life: Quantum Edition</h2>

    <p>
        A Python-based recreation of Conway's Game of Life using Quantum Randomness.
        <br><br><br>
        I decided to make this project to see how the simulation would differ by using quantum 
        generated randomness compared to a classically generated pseudo-random version.
        <br><br><br>
        This program is a more realistic simulation of cellular automata using quantum computing to generate
        the state of each cell randomly with a 50/50 chance to be dead or alive.
