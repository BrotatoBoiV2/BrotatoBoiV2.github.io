        <h1>Recreation of Pong!</h1>

        <p>
            This is a recreation of the classic "Pong!" game a friend challenged me to make within 2 weeks, which only took a few days.
            </br>
            I made this game with the pygame library and compiled it using Pyinstaller to make executables.
            </br>
            This is pretty much a project to get back into things and strengthen my skills.
            While making this project, I found trying to compile the code into an executable with the assets folder included was a bit of a challenge
            especially when it came to cross compiling it to a Windows executable with the assistance of Wine, but I was able to figure out the bugs and complete it!
            </br>
            I learned a great amount about the compiling process and how multi-threading with the pygame events is handled much differently on Windows than Linux.
            This project will be updated, I am planning to rewrite the code using my game engine library I am writing (I will put it up on this site soon), but it is currently in working state.
